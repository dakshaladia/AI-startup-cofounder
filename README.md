# Idea Building With multiple agents using AI

An intelligent platform that helps entrepreneurs discover, evaluate, and refine startup ideas using AI-powered agents and market analysis.

## 🚀 Overview

This project provides a comprehensive AI-driven system for startup idea generation, market analysis, and business planning. It combines multiple specialized AI agents to provide end-to-end support for entrepreneurs.

## 🏗️ Architecture

The system is built with a microservices architecture using Docker containers:

- **Frontend**: Next.js web application with React components
- **Backend**: FastAPI-based API service
- **Agents**: Specialized AI agents for different tasks

- **Evaluator**: Idea scoring and novelty assessment
- **Ingestion**: Data processing pipelines

## 🤖 AI Agents

The platform includes several specialized AI agents:

- **Idea Generator**: Creates innovative startup concepts
- **Market Analyst**: Analyzes market opportunities and trends
- **PM Refiner**: Refines ideas from a product management perspective
- **Critic**: Provides critical analysis and identifies potential issues
- **Synthesizer**: Combines insights from all agents

## 🛠️ Tech Stack
